# RATQ: Roadmap and Technologies for Quran

# Project Goals
1. Mapping out the technologies that can be used by anyone interested in developing Quranic applications.
2. Creating a classification of all development stages that a developer will go through, and comparing the tools available in each category.
3. Identifying areas that have gaps or incomplete services, and clarifying them for the community.
4. Connecting the individual efforts of people and institutions to share expertise and avoid duplication of efforts.
5. Linking supporters with projects that deserve.
