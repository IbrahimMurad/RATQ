# quran-json

## Introduction

A JavaScript package for Quran text and translations in JSON format. It provides Quran text, transliteration, and translations in JSON format.

## Features

- Quran text and translations structured for easy consumption by applications.    
- JSON data available at different granularities: entire Quran, individual chapters (surahs), individual verses.
- Multi-language support.
- Access via CDN links for direct web usage or integration.
- Ability to generate JSON files locally from source for customization or offline usage.
- Provides both Quran text and transliterations together in files.

## Usage

### Using CDN
    
- Access full Quran text JSON `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quran-json@3.1.2/dist/quran.json`.
- Access full Quran with specific language translation, e.g., English `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quran-json@3.1.2/dist/quran_en.json`.
- Access single chapter text only `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quran-json@3.1.2/dist/chapters/{chapterNumber}.json`
- Access single chapter with translation: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quran-json@3.1.2/dist/chapters/{langCode}/{chapterNumber}.json`
- Access single verse `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quran-json@3.1.2/dist/verses/{verseNumber}.json`.

The CDN allows quick integration with no need for hosting files.

### Using NPM (local build):
    
- Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone git@github.com:risan/quran-json.git cd quran-json
```

- Install dependencies: 

```bash
npm install
```


- Generate JSON files locally:
    

```bash
npm run build
```


This process builds the Quran JSON data locally, useful for customization or offline access.
